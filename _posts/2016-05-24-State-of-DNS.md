# DNS and inmotion hosts

I had previously spoken with my hosts that [my website](http://vgvenkataraman.com) redirects to a default inmotion page, more than a week ago.
Sadly enough the issue hasn't been handled yet. I really do hope they figure something out soon and the DNS propagation happens faster. :worried:
