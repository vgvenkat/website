I had previously spoken with my hosts that [my website](http://vgvenkataraman.com) redirects to a default inmotion page, more than a week ago.
Sadly enough the issue hasn't been handled yet. I really do hope they figure something out soon and the DNS propagation happens faster. :worried:

Update : **26 May 2016**

In the past few days, I have learnt the concept of HTTPS and ssl, process of buying/ getting a free ssl certificate, hosting with dedicated IPs and stuff. Its a little complex than I expected and not just the hosting service not turning it on.
At this point in time since I have no user login setup or secure transactions going on, I have not tried to add any https security to my website or blog. 

I have also tried using [let's encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) in these few days since my last post and have hit a few hiccups. Will probably come over this feature when anything I do absolutely needs it.
