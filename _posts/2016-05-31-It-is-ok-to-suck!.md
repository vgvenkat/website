I have been for some time thinking on how to develop myself to point of self assessment where I dont think I suck at something or there are more things to be done to achieve perfection. I have asked people who I think are awesome in the tech scene, asked people in their github ama and read through a lot of blog posts and gone through a ton of video material, tech and otherwise.

I am now currently in a place where I can confortably say, **it is ok to suck**. Every person the one who I admired the most to newbies have to start at some place. I have come to a place where I realize where I am and know where I need to be, setting static endpoints and plotting paths I am now finally relaxed.
This does not mean I am not stopping the pace I learn tech or creating small projects, this just means learning and developing one's self and also a tech skill is an iterative process. You make mistakes and you learn and you now know what happens when and you are a bit wiser.

For me, it has been bringing up good design for products/websites that I build. I am always able to code out from specs than make design specs myself. I have come to an understanding it is fine to slowly learn to get good at design. For now I will focus more on mastering development.
