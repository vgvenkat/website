## Learning to have an universal css framework
#### Grid based Design
 - People usually see from left to right then top to bottom
 - Collection of predefined css classes are called frameworks

 Previously, people set max width of content to **960px** to give some space between the content and width of the screen which were **1024px**.

 **Responsive Design** targets resolution rather than the physical size of screen.

#### 12 column grids
- 12 column grid layout is more versatile for multiple layout systems
- create
  - a row with 100% width
  - columns of 1/12 to 12/12 of page width (1/12 = 8.33%, 2/12 = 16.66%, 12/12 = 100%)

#### Negative space
- means space that does not contain anything.
- removes content clutter
- padding is a great way. margin can also be used.

#### Text overflow
- use it to contain large amount of data in a small area. eg(overflow: auto)
- gives scrolling behavior

#### Media queries
- **Format** @media only screen and (max-width:500px) and (orientation:landscape){}
  - screen for all types of screen based devices or print
  - landscape orientation means width > height

#### Reset css
- normalize.css can give a common base for building

Use placehold.it for placeholder images with dimensions.
