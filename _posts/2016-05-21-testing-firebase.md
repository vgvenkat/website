I just saw a tweet on how easy it was to use firebase for hosting a blog. 
![Tweet-about-easy-firebase](/images/firebase-tweet.png "tweet about firebase")
Looking at the tweet, it really looked *easy* .

Saw a few videos from google io '16'. Now testing it out from [Firebase starting point](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/quickstart "starting point")

The steps are really easy and it actually took no time running a dummy website website!
