There have always been an overwhelming number of things I wanted to do at any point in time. Writing things down and may be having a fixed and visual set of things would clear my head than keep things floating.

-[] Complete Udacity Nanodegree
-[] Understand and build micro interaction animation projects
-[] ES6
-[] Proper workflow with angular, gulp, babel
-[] Check out Firebase
-[] Google Tag manager (post and video in CSS-Tricks)

Softwares I want to try out

-[] Does it make sense to buy Codekit
-[] Does it make sense to buy Sketch
-[] Checkout the dude who has tutorials on Sketch, iphone development thingy(probably saved in pocket) and has a paid book.

At some point in time

-[] Hacker Rank
-[] Facebook bots
-[] Make stuff out of MSFT, Google, FB, Twitter APIs
