# Tips on using Bootstrap
- Gauge what you need and get the custom bootstrap zip for a smaller file size.
- use online tools like http://cssminifier.com/ to minify css if not using task runners.
- make images responsive by using ```img-responsive``` class
- While writing custom css, always start from the biggest to smaller specific element styles.
- When working with a designer, ask feedback when you are done with the web part. Also know it is extremely difficult to match the mockup exactly, at some point call it a day.

## Custom vs 3rd party frameworks

- If everything you need is done by 3rd party go for it
- If you need features that are not supported by 3rd party, do a combination of both.
- Have a compelling reason to go fully custom.
